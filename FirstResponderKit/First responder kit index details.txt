Reads : user_seeks + user_scans + user_lookups

Writes: user_updates
Number of updates by user queries. This includes Insert, Delete, and Updates representing number of operations done not the actual rows affected.

Singleton lookups :total_singleton_lookup_count

scans/seek :total_range_scan_count

deletes :total_leaf_delete_count

updates: total_leaf_update_count



leaf_insert_count,-number of times operation was done, NOT pages NOT ROWS
leaf_delete_count,
leaf_update_count,It gives the maintenance cost of the index. That is how many time a DML statement has caused this index to need to be updated.
leaf_ghost_count- number of times operation was done, NOT pages NOT ROWS

********************************

unique_compiles : Compiles
Number of compilations and recompilations that would benefit from this missing index group. C
ompilations and recompilations of many different queries can contribute to this column value.

avg_user_impact AS [Est Index Improvement]
Average percentage benefit that user queries could experience if this missing index group was implemented. 
The value means that the query cost would on average drop by this percentage if this missing index group was implemented.


user_seeks AS [Seeks]
Number of seeks caused by user queries that the recommended index in the group could have been used for.

user_scans AS [Scans]
Number of scans caused by user queries that the recommended index in the group could have been used for.


avg_total_user_cost AS [Avg Query Cost]
Average cost of the user queries that could be reduced by the index in the group

index_estimated_impact AS [Estimated Impact]
